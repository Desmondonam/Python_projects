'''
Mean, Median and Mode are the fundamentals of statistics used in almost 
every domain where we deal with numbers. Python is one of the best programming 
languages for numerical calculations. So you should know how to calculate mean,
 median and mode using Python without using any built-in Python library or module. 
 So in this article, I will take you through how to calculate mean, median, 
 and mode using Python
'''

# Mean
list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
mean = sum(list1)/len(list1)
print(mean)

# Median
list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
list1.sort()

if len(list1) % 2 == 0:
    m1 = list1[len(list1)//2]
    m2 = list1[len(list1)//2 - 1]
    median = (m1 + m2)/2
else:
    median = list1[len(list1)//2]
print(median)

# Mode
list1 = [12, 16, 20, 20, 12, 30, 25, 23, 24, 20]
frequency = {}
for i in list1:
    frequency.setdefault(i, 0)
    frequency[i]+=1

frequent = max(frequency.values())
for i, j in frequency.items():
    if j == frequent:
        mode = i
print(mode)
