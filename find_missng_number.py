This code is for finding the missing value. 
it is valuable for the leetcode challenge interview

Given an array containing a range of numbers from 0 to n with a missing number, 
find the missing number in the input array.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
| To find the missing number in an array, we need to iterate over the   |
| input array and store the numbers in another array that we didnâ€™t find| 
| in the input array while iterating over it. Below is how you can find |
| the missing number in an array or a list using the Python programming |
| language:                                                             |
